/**
 
Presents the stack of cards, configured in the SDK's dashboard, including different types of Ads (e.g. Facebook Native Ads, DFP, Video Ads, etc.) on top of the host app UI.
 
To quick start the SDK please copy the lines below and paste them into your AppDelegate's <b>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions</b> method
    
    [BuzzSDK startWithAPIKey: @"YOUR_API_KEY" secretKey: @"YOUR_SECRET_KEY"];
    [BuzzSDK presentDeck];
 
BuzzSDK supports multiple presentation modes. Default presentation mode is set to <b>Manual</b>, which means that SDK will wait for a [BuzzSDK presentDeck]
call to actually present the card deck. 
 
<b>Available Presentation Modes: </b> <i>Never</i>, <i>Manual</i>, <i>Once per day</i>, <i>Once per week</i>, <i>Whenever app becomes active</i>. All modes are configurable through the dashboard.

<b>Prerequisites to running Facebook Native Ads and Medium Rectangle Ads using DFP (Double Click for Publishers)</b>

1. First, please make sure you have "-ObjC" flag set in the "Other Linker Flags" section of your app target's Build Settings.
2. Next, link either FBAudienceNetwork.framework or GoogleMobileAds.framework (or both) to your app's target.
3. Specify your "Ad placement IDs" in the SDK's dashboard.
 
<b>Advanced SDK launch example (with options):</b>
 
Set a delegate to navigate users on article card taps to relevant content inside the app:

    [BuzzSDK setDelegate:self]
 
Initialize the BuzzSDK with API key and secret key
 
    [BuzzSDK startWithAPIKey:@"YOUR_API_KEY" secretKey:@"YOUR_SECRET_KEY" andSDKOptions:sdkOptions];

Present the SDK's UI
 
    [BuzzSDK presentDeck];
 
<b>SDK Cards Styling</b>
 
Optionally, you can apply styles to the title and kicker of article and video cards.

Available styling options for card kicker & title:

 - font name
 - font size
 - text color
 - background color
 
You can find more information about supported option keys in <BUZZSDKOptions.h> header file.
 
@warning Note about the fonts. For custom fonts, which are not a part of the iOS SDK, you should include them into your app's bundle, and add corresponding key to the plist file.
